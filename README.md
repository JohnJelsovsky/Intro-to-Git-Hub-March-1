This is a test repository. You will find nothing particularly interesting here.
The size limit is 1 GB (soft) 5GB (hard) per repository for a free account, but you can have unlimited repositories.
That's a lot of space. If the data to be worked on can be stored elsewhere, its enough for pretty much anything.
